## 🚧 Potential Improvements

With additional time, I would further enhance the project by:

- Improving logic around AI note generation for increased stability and predictability.
- Refining loading states and overall UI transitions for smoother navigation.
- Incorporating exact icons directly from Figma designs (a library was used temporarily to streamline development).
- Achieving an even closer pixel-perfect UI match, prioritizing the remaining aspects of design fidelity.
